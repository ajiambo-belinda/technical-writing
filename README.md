1. **Keep it updated**: Update the README as your project evolves
2. **Be concise**: Avoid unnecessary details
3. **Use examples**: Show real code examples
4. **Format properly**: Use Markdown formatting for readability
5. **Include visuals**: Add screenshots or diagrams when helpful
6. **Make it scannable**: Use clear headings and bullet points

## File Naming

- Primary README should be named `README.md` (all caps)
- Can also have additional documentation files like:
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
  - `LICENSE.md`

Remember that the README is often the first thing people see about your project, so make it clear, informative, and welcoming!
